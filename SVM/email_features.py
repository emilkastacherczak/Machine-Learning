    # FIXME: ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ============================
    # Instructions: Fill in this function to return a feature vector for the
    #               given email (word_indices). To help make it easier to 
    #               process the emails, we have have already pre-processed each
    #               email and converted each word in the email into an index in
    #               a fixed dictionary (of 1899 words). The variable
    #               word_indices contains the list of indices of the words
    #               which occur in one email.
    # 
    #               Concretely, if an email has the text:
    #
    #                  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
    #
    #               Then, the word_indices vector for this text might look 
    #               like:
    #               
    #                   60  100   33   44   10     53  60  58   5
    #
    #               where, we have mapped each word onto a number, for example:
    #
    #                   the   -- 60
    #                   quick -- 100
    #                   ...
    #
    #              (note: the above numbers are just an example and are not the
    #               actual mappings).
    #
    #              Your task is take one such word_indices vector and construct
    #              a binary feature vector that indicates whether a particular
    #              word occurs in the email. That is, x(i) = 1 when word i
    #              is present in the email. Concretely, if the word 'the' (say,
    #              index 60) appears in the email, then x(60) = 1. The feature
    #              vector should look like:
    #
    #              x = [ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 1 ... 0 0 0 1 0 ..];
    #
    # =========================================================================

    x = np.zeros((1, n_words))
    for i in range(n_words):
        if i in word_indices:
            x[0, i] = 1

    return x
